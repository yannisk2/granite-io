      Works that You distribute must\n          include a readable copy of the attribution
      notices contained\n          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices
      that do not\n          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least
      one\n          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed\n          as
      part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or\n          documentation,
      if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,\n          within a display
      generated by the Derivative Works, if and\n          wherever such third-party
      notices normally appear. The contents\n          of the NOTICE file are for

      Your use,\n      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies
      with\n      the conditions stated in this License.\n\n   5. Submission of Contributions.
      Unless You explicitly state otherwise,\n      any Contribution intentionally
      submitted for inclusion in the Work\n      by You to the Licensor shall be under
      the terms and conditions of\n      this License, without any additional terms

      not grant permission to use the trade\n      names, trademarks, service marks,
      or product names of the Licensor,\n      except as required for reasonable and
      customary use in describing the\n      origin of the Work and reproducing the
      content of the NOTICE file.\n\n   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required
      by applicable law or\n      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work

      responsible for determining the\n      appropriateness of using or redistributing
      the Work and assume any\n      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions
      under this License.\n\n   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under
      no legal theory,\n      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or
      otherwise,\n      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and
      grossly\n      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor
      be\n      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n      incidental,
      or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n      result of this
      License or out of the use or inability to use the\n      Work (including but
      not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n      work stoppage, computer
      failure or malfunction, or any and all\n      other commercial damages or losses),
      even if such Contributor\n      has been advised of the possibility of such
      damages.\n\n   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge
      a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability
      obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting
      such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole
      responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You
      agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any
      liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by
      reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n   END

      one\n          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed\n          as
      part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or\n          documentation,
      if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,\n          within a display
      generated by the Derivative Works, if and\n          wherever such third-party
      notices normally appear. The contents\n          of the NOTICE file are for

      distribute, alongside\n          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the
      Work, provided\n          that such additional attribution notices cannot be
      construed\n          as modifying the License.\n\n      You may add Your own
      copyright statement to Your modifications and\n      may provide additional
      or different license terms and conditions\n      for use, reproduction, or distribution
      of Your modifications, or\n      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided
      Your use,\n      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies
      with\n      the conditions stated in this License.\n\n   5. Submission of Contributions.
      Unless You explicitly state otherwise,\n      any Contribution intentionally
      submitted for inclusion in the Work\n      by You to the Licensor shall be under
      the terms and conditions of\n      this License, without any additional terms

      Licensor regarding such Contributions.\n\n   6. Trademarks. This License does
      not grant permission to use the trade\n      names, trademarks, service marks,
      or product names of the Licensor,\n      except as required for reasonable and
      customary use in describing the\n      origin of the Work and reproducing the
      content of the NOTICE file.\n\n   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required
      by applicable law or\n      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work
      (and each\n      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n      WITHOUT

      MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A\n      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely
      responsible for determining the\n      appropriateness of using or redistributing
      the Work and assume any\n      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions
      under this License.\n\n   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under
      no legal theory,\n      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or
      otherwise,\n      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and
      grossly\n      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor
      be\n      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n      incidental,
      or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n      result of this
      License or out of the use or inability to use the\n      Work (including but
      not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n      work stoppage, computer
      failure or malfunction, or any and all\n      other commercial damages or losses),
      even if such Contributor\n      has been advised of the possibility of such
      damages.\n\n   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge
      a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability
      obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting
      such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole
      responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You
      agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any
      liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by
      reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n   END
