      0\n<c0> Git Repos and Issue Tracking is an IBM-hosted component of the Continuous
      Delivery service. <c1> All of the data that you provide to Git Repos and Issue
      Tracking, including but not limited to source files, issues, pull requests,
      and project configuration properties, is managed securely within Continuous
      Delivery. <c2> However, Git Repos and Issue Tracking supports various mechanisms
      for exporting, sending, or otherwise sharing data to users and third parties.
      <c3> The ability of Git Repos and Issue Tracking to share information is typical
      of many social coding platforms. <c4> However, such sharing might conflict with
      regulatory controls that apply to your business. <c5> After you create a project
      in Git Repos and Issue Tracking, but before you entrust any files, issues, records,
      or other data with the project, review the project settings and change any settings
      that you deem necessary to protect your data. <c6> Settings to review include
      visibility levels, email notifications, integrations, web hooks, access tokens,
      deploy tokens, and deploy keys. <c7> Project visibility levels \n\nGit Repos
      and Issue Tracking projects can have one of the following visibility levels:
      private, internal, or public. <c8> * Private projects are visible only to project
      members. <c9> This setting is the default visibility level for new projects,
      and is the most secure visibility level for your data. <c10> * Internal projects
      are visible to all users that are logged in to IBM Cloud. <c11> * Public projects
      are visible to anyone. <c12> To limit project access to only project members,
      complete the following steps:\n\n\n\n1. <c13> From the project sidebar, click
      Settings > General. <c14> 2. <c15> On the General Settings page, click Visibility
      > project features > permissions. <c16> 3. <c17> Locate the Project visibility
      setting. <c18> 4. <c19> Select Private, if it is not already selected. <c20>
      5. <c21> Click Save changes. <c22> Project membership \n\nGit Repos and Issue
      Tracking is a cloud hosted social coding environment that is available to all
      Continuous Delivery users. <c23> If you are a Git Repos and Issue Tracking project
      Maintainer or Owner, you can invite any user and group members to the project.
      <c24> IBM Cloud places no restrictions on who you can invite to a project.\n\nDocument

      Project email settings \n\nBy default, Git Repos and Issue Tracking notifies
      project members by way of email about project activities. <c43> These emails
      typically include customer-owned data that was provided to Git Repos and Issue
      Tracking by users. <c44> For example, if a user posts a comment to an issue,
      Git Repos and Issue Tracking sends an email to all subscribers. <c45> The email
      includes information such as a copy of the comment, the user who posted it,
      and when the comment was posted. <c46> To turn off all email notifications for
      your project, complete the following steps:\n\n\n\n1. <c47> From the project
      sidebar, click Settings > General. <c48> 2. <c49> On the **General Settings
